    An unrevealed tile might have a black hole behind it, it might not. The idea
    is to clear all the tiles that <strong>don't</strong> have black holes
    behind them.
  </p>,
  <p>
    But, the thing about a black hole – its main distinguishing feature – is
    it's black. And the thing about space, the color of space, your basic space
    color, is black. So how are you supposed to avoid them? Here's how:

    If you avoid a black hole, the number tells you how many of the 8
    surrounding tiles are a black hole. If it's blank, <strong>none</strong> of
    the surrounding tiles is a black hole.

  <p>If you think you know where a black hole is, flag it!</p>
